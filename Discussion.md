Solutions Considered:

Naive Line-by-Line Scan:

This was the initial and most straightforward approach. It involved opening the large log file, reading each line, and checking if the line started with the target date.
Pros: Simple to implement.
Cons: Inefficient for very large files, as it requires scanning the entire file regardless of the date's distribution.
Indexing and Offset-Based Retrieval (Potentially):

For a truly massive file, one could consider creating an index that maps dates to file offsets. This would allow direct access to the relevant sections of the file.
Pros: Highly efficient for repeated queries on different dates.
Cons: Requires significant pre-processing to build the index, and adds complexity.
Database Integration (Potentially):

Importing the log data into a database would enable efficient querying using SQL.
Pros: Very powerful and flexible.
Cons: Requires database setup and data import, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Splitting the log file:

One could split the large log file into multiple smaller files, each containing logs for a specific day.
Pros: Improves speed.
Cons: Requires pre-processing, and storage space.
Final Solution Summary:

The final solution utilizes the naive line-by-line scan approach.
This was chosen because:
The problem statement mentioned that logs are "nearly evenly distributed across days," which suggests that a simple scan would not be excessively inefficient.
The goal was to optimize for the "first query," and the naive approach avoids the pre-processing overhead of indexing or database integration.
It is the easiest to implement.
For a 1TB log file, this solution should be sufficient for a one time search.
For repeated queries, or for extremely large files, indexing or database integration would be more appropriate.
Steps to Run:

Save the Code:

Save the provided Python code as this_program.py.
Create the Log File:

Create a text file named logs_2024.txt in the same directory as this_program.py.
Add log entries to logs_2024.txt in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmm - LEVEL - Message. For example:
2024-12-04T22:35:47.0000 - DEBUG - API request timeout.
2024-08-22T07:43:08.0000 - DEBUG - API request timeout.
2024-12-04T10:15:23.0000 - INFO - User logged in.
2024-12-05T09:00:00.0000 - WARNING - Disk space running low.
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:

Navigate to the directory containing this_program.py and logs_2024.txt.
Run the Script:

Execute the following command, replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the desired date:
Bash

python this_program.py 2024-12-04
Check the Output:

The script will create an output folder (if it doesn't already exist).
Inside the output folder, you will find a file named output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt (e.g., output_2024-12-04.txt).
This file will contain the log entries for the specified date.
